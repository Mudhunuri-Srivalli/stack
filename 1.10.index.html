  <p>Flowers, also known as blossoms and blooms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. Typically, 
    they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. These include: sepals, which are modified
     leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; 
     and female gynoecia, where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, 
     they are known collectively as an inflorescence.</p>
